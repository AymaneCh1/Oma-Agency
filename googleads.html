            <p class="lead">Since the inception of the Internet, advertising has fundamentally changed. Gone are the days of simply running ads in your local newspaper, radio, or TV channel. Nowadays, every website is a potential space for you to get your name out there. If you had to individually contact every single page you wanted to advertise on, the process would be endless and you would never make any progress in any campaign you’re trying to run. Thankfully, we have Google and Google Ads to help out. Google can be a bit daunting when it comes to advertising, so it helps to have a few tips and tricks in mind to prepare yourself properly. Today, we’ll be discussing some Google Ad tips so you can make the most of whatever campaign you’d like to run. </p>
            <h3 class="py-2">Keywords</h3>
            <p>The first, and perhaps most important of the Google Ad tips involves using keywords. When advertising online, Google Ads, along with most other programs for advertising regardless of platform, will prompt you to add some keywords so that the ad itself knows where best to advertise as well as makes the ad searchable when people use a search engine. 

            </p>
            <h4 class="py-2">Variety</h4>
            <blockquote><p>Our first tip is variety. More likely than not you’ll be running multiple campaigns simultaneously. Along with that, your topics may be very similar if you are working either on the same client or your company itself. Coming up with numerous keywords on the same topic may be difficult and the easy option may seem to be using the same keywords across different campaigns, but you’ll want to avoid doing this. Even if you feel you’ve come up with the perfect single keyword for every one of your campaigns you’ll want to avoid this for one simple reason: you’ll be making your campaigns compete against each other. This is obviously unwise as you’ll be weakening the effectiveness of both or all campaigns involved. When you are already competing with hundreds, if not thousands, of other companies, the last thing you want to do is handicap yourself. 

            </p></blockquote>
            <h4 class="py-2">Get Specific</h4>
            <p>Another of the Google Ad tips involving keywords is how specific you get with your keyword selections. There is a common belief in the marketing world that you want to be broad with your net to try and catch as much attention as possible and bring in the maximum amount of eyes to your product or service. There are those who would recommend not using any kind of branded terms because that will limit your reach. Those same people would tell you to use as many keywords as possible to make your net as big as possible.</p>
            <p>These pieces of advice are not good ones for several reasons. While they are technically correct that you’ll be creating as wide a net as possible with this method, the engagement you’ll get from it isn’t worth it. In marketing, quality nearly always trumps quantity. It doesn’t matter how many people see your ad if no one clicks on it. You want to make your work engaging and by going after a smaller, but more focused audience, you will be much more likely to succeed in driving attention and clicks where you want them.</p>
            <h4 class="py-2">Branded</h4>
            <p>Another benefit of using branded keywords is that when using Google and many other ad producing programs, you are ranked based on both engagement and consistent branding. If Google detects too much discrepancy between your ads and your landing page, it won’t put your ads in front of as many people. By using branded keywords, you are more closely aligning your ads with your brand which will in turn help Google Ads drive more traffic exactly where you want it.</p>
            <h3 class="py-2">Audiences</h3>
            <p>If you’ve done any advertising on the Internet in recent years, you know the importance of retargeting to your best audience. For those not aware of that term, retargeting is the process of taking warm audiences – people more likely to buy – acquired from a previous campaign or ad piece and showing them new creative to get them to convert. Of the Google Ad tips, this one should act as more of a wakeup to people who haven’t delved deep enough into the options that Google has. Many who use Google Ads stick with the “search network” function as it uses intent-to-buy as its primary metric. Intent-to-buy is a relatively simple concept. Say you are striving to sell boxes and you target anyone who searches the term “moving boxes.” This targeting will begin showing the people who performed that search ads for your boxes.</p>
            <p>While this is a direct method, it isn’t always terribly effective. If a person is already searching for something, oftentimes you are too late, as people will select the first option they find in their search. If you can, you want to be on their mind before they make their search. This is where audiences come in. Google has an extremely deep targeting system if you are willing to put in the time to learn and dig through it. You can use it to target people with specific search histories, people who’ve gone to certain pages, and even specific demographics you feel would be most likely to purchase your product or service. Just remember to put in the work to learn how Google Ads works with audience retargeting and you will be in a much better position to succeed.</p>
            <h4 class="py-2">Data</h4>
            <p>The final of the Google Ad tips we’ll discuss today is  in regards to using data you’ve acquired to make the best campaign possible. One of the best ways you can utilize data with Google ads is through UTM tracking. UTM stands for “Urchin Tracking Module” which is a program that Google purchased years ago that laid the groundwork for what we know as Google Analytics today. At its core, UTM codes are pieces of text within an individual link that you can use to track how people interact with a piece of media.</p>
            <p>UTM codes are a part of every single piece of media that you post. This can come in very handy as every image or link you create can be manipulated to tell you something about the person clicking it. The best way to use UTM codes is to see exactly where traffic is coming from. Within URLs you can make adjustments that give you information that can be used both in redirection and retargeting of your new potential customers. Once again, Google offers tons of options if you are willing to dig through them and find what works best for your business.</p>
            <h3 class="py-2">Conclusion</h3>
            <blockquote><p>Google Ads is an efficient targeting platform for a variety of ad formats.  With Google Ads, you have far greater control over the information you can glean as you know exactly where people are coming from and can take advantage of that data. . With these Google Ad tips you can hopefully improve your methods and really begin to see  a boost in sales and marketing efforts.</p></blockquote>
